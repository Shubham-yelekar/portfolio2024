Week one of the [**Namaste DSA**](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-dsa) course I’ve learned the Space time complexity concept , here are the few point I’ve noted

### What is BigO notation?

- Categorize an algorithms **time** or **memory** based on input; Growth w.r.t Input
- The use Data Structures determines the algorithms that effects BigO

### **O(n) – Linear Time**

- **Meaning:** Time grows **directly** with input size.
- **Example:**
  - Searching for a number in a list by **checking one by one**.
  - Reversing a list by **going through each item**.
