Week one of the [**Namaste DSA**](https://namastedev.com/learn/namaste-dsa) course I’ve learned the Space time complexity concept , here are the few point I’ve noted

### What is BigO notation?

- Categorize an algorithms **time** or **memory** based on input; Growth w.r.t Input
- The use Data Structures determines the algorithms that effects BigO

---

### **O(n)** – Linear Time

- **Meaning:** Time grows **directly** with input size.
- **Example:**
  - Searching for a number in a list by **checking one by one**.
  - Reversing a list by **going through each item**.

---

### **O(n²) – Quadratic Time**

- **Meaning:** Time grows **much faster** because of **loops inside loops**.
- **Example:**
  - Comparing **every pair** of numbers in a list.
  - Sorting a list using **Bubble Sort** or **Selection Sort**.

/>

---

### **O(n log n) – Log-Linear Time**

- **Meaning:** Split the work into **halves**, then process each half.
- **Example:**
  - Sorting a list using **Quick Sort** or **Merge Sort**.

/>

---

### **O(log n) – Logarithmic Time**

- **Meaning:** Time grows **very slowly** as input size increases.
- **Example:**
  - Searching in a **sorted list** by **cutting it in half** each time (**Binary Search**).

---

### **O(1) – Constant Time**

- **Meaning:** Time stays the **same** no matter the input size.
- **Example:**
  - Accessing an item in an array by index.
  - Inserting/removing at the end of a stack.
  - Checking if a number is even or odd.

/>

---

### **O(2ⁿ) – Exponential Time**

- **Meaning:** Time **doubles** with each additional input.
- **Example:**
  - Solving the **Subset Sum Problem.**
  - Calculating all subsets of a set.
  - **Recursive Fibonacci** without memoization.

/>

---

### **O(n!) – Factorial Time**

- **Meaning:** Time grows **extremely** fast, worse than exponential.
- **Example:**
  - Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (brute-force).
  - Generating all **permutations** of a list.

### What is Space Complexity?

Space Complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size (n).

This includes:

- Input storage
- Temporary variables
- Function call stack (in recursion)
- Auxiliary data structures (arrays, hashmaps, etc.)

#### Examples

##### O(1) – Constant Space

- Uses the same fixed amount of memory, regardless of input size.

```javascript
function isEven(n) {
  return n % 2 === 0; // uses no extra memory
}
```

##### O(n) – Linear Space

- Memory usage grows directly with input size.

```javascript
function copyArray(arr) {
  return [...arr]; // creates a new array of size n
}
```

##### O(n²) – Quadratic Space

- Common when using a 2D matrix or storing all pairs.
- Creating an n x n grid.

##### Time vs Space Trade-off

- Sometimes we use **more memory** to make the algorithm faster.
- Example: Using a **hash table** to avoid repeated calculations in memoization.

---

#### Conclusion

- Big-O Notation helps analyze how an algorithm's time and space grow with input size.

- It’s essential for writing efficient code, especially with large data.

- Time Complexity tells us how fast an algorithm runs.
  Space Complexity tells us how much memory it uses.

- Different problems demand different trade-offs between speed and memory.

- Knowing Big-O helps in:

  - Choosing the right data structures
  - Optimizing performance
  - Cracking coding interviews and solving real-world problems

> Always aim for the lowest complexity that still meets the problem’s needs.
