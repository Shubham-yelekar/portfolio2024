I had no clue how to build such dynamic meshes or make my geometries move, and my materials change colors. A few Google searches later: I got introduced to the concept of shaders that make scenes like the one above possible, and I wanted to know everything about them. However, shaders are incredibly difficult. Thus, I spent the past few weeks studying them, learned new techniques, created dozens of scenes from scratch, and hit as many roadblocks.
